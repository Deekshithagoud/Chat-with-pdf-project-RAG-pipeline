Project Title: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline with LangChain

Description:
This project demonstrates how to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using LangChain and FAISS. It retrieves relevant text data from a vector database and uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate accurate answers to user queries.

Requirements:

Python 3.8 or higher
OpenAI API Key
Required Libraries:
langchain
openai
faiss-cpu
Install dependencies using:

pip install langchain openai faiss-cpu
Steps to Run:

Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git  
cd repo-name  
Set Up OpenAI API Key:
Export your key as an environment variable:
arduino

export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
Run the Notebook:
Open the RAG_langchain.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible editor and run the cells step by step.

How It Works:

Generate Embeddings:
Text data is converted into embeddings using OpenAI's embedding model.

Store Embeddings:
FAISS stores the embeddings and enables fast retrieval based on similarity search.

Retrieve Relevant Chunks:
The query is compared to the stored embeddings, and the top matches are retrieved.

Generate Final Answer:
Retrieved data is passed as context to an LLM (e.g., GPT-3.5) to produce an answer.

Example Query:
Input: "What is FAISS?"
Output:
"FAISS is a library that performs fast similarity search on dense vector embeddings. It is widely used for efficient retrieval tasks in AI pipelines."

To-Do:

Add more document formats (PDF, URLs) for retrieval.
Enhance prompt design for better LLM responses.
Reduce fetching time of answer to the query.
